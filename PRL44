Nursing
Verify that patient meets the lab parameters for administration. 
Confirm that the patient has taken oral premeds prior to starting paclitaxel.  If not, notify pharmacy
Perform assessment for toxicity and tolerance.  
Ensure patient has had baseline and subsequent ejection fraction if ordered by MD.
Begin 0.9% saline as primary line to keep vein open. 
Review regional guideline for extravasation of vesicants/irritants.  
RN to verify dose per syringe to equal total dose to be administered.  
Administer vesicant IVP, using free flow method or side arm technique, once IV patency is confirmed.
If administering vesicant IVP, verify blood return every 2 to 5 mL during administration.
IV pump not recommended for administration of doxorubicin, administer IVPB per gravity.
Administer vesicant IVPB once IV patency is confirmed.
If administering vesicant IVPB via a peripheral IV, remain with the patient and verify blood return every 5 to 10 minutes.
When administering a vesicant IVP or IVPB, observe and assess site for pain, swelling and redness during infusion.
When administering a vesicant IVP or IVPB, instruct patient to alert the nurse if any pain, burning, swelling or redness during infusion.
Use non PVC tubing for administration.
Filter paclitaxel with a 0.22 micron in-line filter.
Paclitaxel should be infused over 3 hours.  Begin infusion at 50 mL/hr for 15 minutes, if patient tolerates and BP is stable, increase to 100 mL/hr for 15 minutes, if patient tolerates and BP is stable increase to 150 mL/hr for 15 minutes.  If patient tolerates infusion and BP is stable, titrate so that the remaining volume is completed within the total 3 hour infusion period.
Infusion-related reactions, STOP infusion immediately, and begin primary solution at wide open rate, notify MD, begin monitoring vital signs and administer prn medication for infusion reaction; 30 minutes after symptoms have resolved restart paclitaxel infusion at 50% of the rate when reaction occurred.
Flush IV line with minimum of 30 mL of primary solution before and after each chemotherapy drug.
Instruct patient on importance of maintaining oral intake to 2 liters per day for 72 hours.
Instruct patient to contact health care team if not voiding or taking adequate fluids frequently for 72 hours.
Review discharge medications, instructions and future appointments.
