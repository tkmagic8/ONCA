Hydrocortisone (SOLU-CORTEF) 100 mg.  Give IV push one time, if needed for hypersensitivity reaction due to chemotherapy. 
DiphenhydrAMINE (BENADRYL) 50 mg.  Give IV push one time, if needed for hypersensitivity reaction due to chemotherapy.
 
Nursing
~  Verify that patient meets the lab parameters for administrations.
~  Ensure patient has had baseline and subsequent EF% if ordered by MD.
~  Perform assessment for toxicity and tolerance.
~  Begin D5W as primary line to keep vein open.
~  If any hydration is desired, be aware that liposomal products are incompatible with saline solutions.
~  For initial doxorubicin liposomal infusion, infuse over 90 minutes.
~  For subsequent infusions, infuse over 60 minutes. 
~  Infusion-related reactions, STOP infusion immediately, and begin primary solution at wide open rate, notify MD, begin monitoring vital signs and administer PRN medication for infusion reaction; once symptoms have resolved, consult with MD on rate to resume doxorubicin liposomal infusion.
~  Flush line with a minimum of 30 mL of primary solution before and after each chemotherapy drug.
~  Review discharge medications, instructions and future appointments.
