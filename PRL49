Baseline Labs (one time draw, prior to first cycle):
SCr, Ca, 25-Hydroxy Vitamin D level, Serum Albumin
________________________________________________________________________________________________
 
Lab Parameters to Assess:
Day 1: CrCl greater than 29 mL/min; Increase in SCr from baseline of less than 0.5 mg/dL (baseline SCr less than 1.4 mg/dL) or increase in SCr from baseline of less than 1 mg/dL (baseline SCr greater than or equal to 1.4 mg/dL)
 
Labs Before Treatment (see specific timing below):
Day 1: SCr, Ca
 
Premedications
0.9% saline 500 mL.  Infuse at 20 mL/hr as primary line to keep vein open.
Antiemetics (Level 1 - No default prophylactic antiemetics)
 
Treatment
Pamidronate (AREDIA) 90 mg in 0.9% saline 500 mL IVPB.  Infuse over 2 hours.  Give on day 1 of each cycle.
Dose Modifications 
If the baseline SCr is normal and the SCr increases by 0.5 mg/dL or more, or the baseline SCr is abnormal and the SCr increases by 1 mg/dL or more, hold pamidronate for two weeks and re-check the SCr. If the SCr level has returned to within 10% of the baseline level, then infuse pamidronate at the original dose. If the SCr does not return to within 10% of baseline, then continue to hold pamidronate until authorized to resume by MD.
