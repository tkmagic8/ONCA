DiphenhydrAMINE (BENADRYL) 50 mg.  Give IV push one time, if needed for hypersensitivity reaction due to chemotherapy.
 
Nursing
Begin 0.9% saline as primary line to keep vein open.
If patient experiences venous irritation during infusion, assess on pain scale of 0 to 10 and titrate and run fluids concurrently.       
 Mild pain level of 0 to 3:  Increase fluids to 100 ml/hr     
 Moderate pain level of 4 to 6:  Increase fluids to 200 ml/hr     
 Severe pain level 7 to 10:  Increase fluids to 300 ml/hr
Verify that patient meets the lab parameters for administration. 
Confirm that the patient has taken oral premeds prior to starting paclitaxel.  If not, notify pharmacy 
Perform assessment for toxicity and tolerance.
Use non PVC bags and tubing for administration.
Use a 0.22 micron in-line filter with paclitaxel.
Paclitaxel should be infused over 3 hours.  Begin infusion at 50 mL/hr for 15 minutes, if patient tolerates and BP is stable, increase to 100 mL/hr for 15 minutes, if patient tolerates and BP is stable increase to 150 mL/hr for 15 minutes.  If patient tolerates and BP is stable, titrate infusion so that the remaining volume is completed within the total 3 hour infusion period.
Infusion-related reaction with paclitaxel: STOP infusion immediately, and begin primary solution at wide open rate, notify MD, begin monitoring vital signs and administer prn medication for infusion reaction; 30 minutes after  symptoms have resolved restart paclitaxel infusion at 50% of the rate when reaction occurred.
Infusion related reaction with carboplatin: STOP infusion immediately, and begin primary solution at wide open rate, notify MD, begin monitoring vital signs and administer prn medication for infusion reaction; once symptoms have resolved consult with MD on rate to resume carboplatin infusion.
Flush IV line with minimum of 30 mL of primary solution before and after each chemotherapy drug.
Review discharge medications, instructions and future appointments.
