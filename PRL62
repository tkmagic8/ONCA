Nursing Orders
Begin 0.9% saline as primary line to keep vein open.
Verify that patient meets the lab parameters for administration.
Perform assessment for toxicity and tolerance.
See MAR for rituximab titration schedule.
Infusion-related reaction with rituximab: STOP infusion immediately, and begin primary solution at wide open rate, notify MD, begin monitoring vital signs and administer PRN medication for infusion reaction; 30 minutes after symptoms have resolved restart rituximab infusion at 50% of the rate when reaction occurred.
If being administered IVPB via a peripheral IV, administer via gravity over 5 to 10 minutes while being observed.
If being administered IVPB via a Central line, an infusion pump may be used.
Administer vesicant IVPB once IV patency is confirmed.
When administering vesicant IVPB via a peripheral IV, remain with the patient and verify blood return every 5 to 10 minutes.
When administering a vesicant IVPB, observe and assess site for pain, swelling and redness during infusion.
When administering a vesicant IVPB, instruct patient to alert the nurse if any pain, burning, swelling or redness during infusion.
Flush IV line with minimum of 30 mL of primary solution before and after each chemotherapy drug.
