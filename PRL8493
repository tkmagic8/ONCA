Provider Reminders
Protocol for patients who weigh 45 kg or more.  
Dexamethasone 10 mg/m2 PO/IV (with increase to max 24 mg/day) daily during screening/pre-phase until cycle 1 day 1 mandatory for all patients in whom proportion of blasts exceeds 50% or peripheral blast count greater than or equal to 15,000
Dexamethasone 10 mg/m2 PO/IV (with increase to max 24 mg/day) daily during screening/pre-phase until cycle 1 day 1 recommended if LDH indicates rapidly progressing disease or extramedullary high tumor load.
Hospitalization is recommended for the first 9 days of the first cycle and the first 2 days of each subsequent cycle. 
Consider tocilizumab 4 mg/kg IV over 1 hour for grade 3 or grade 4 Cytokine Release Syndrome, or if no response to supportive care for grade 2 toxicity.  Dose may be repeated if clinical improvement does not occur within 24 to 48 hours.
Consider CNS chemoprophylaxis per Topp, et al. JCO 2014;32:4134-4140.

Treatment
Cycle 1 
Blinatumomab (BLINCYTO) 9 mcg/24 hours in 250 mL 0.9% Sodium Chloride. Infuse by continuous IV infusion at 10 mL/hr for 24 hours on days 1 through 7. Do not flush or interrupt blinatumomab infusion line. Infuse exactly at ordered rate through a dedicated lumen. Do not increase the rate of infusion to finish the bag; start new bag every 24 hours. There will be residual medication left in the bag, dispose of properly. Use IV tubing that contains a sterile, non-pyrogenic, non-DEHP, low protein-binding, 0.2 micron in-line filter.
Pharmacy note: refer to package insert for special reconstitution requirements.  Verify and adjust final concentration and volume as necessary.
 
Blinatumomab (BLINCYTO) 28 mcg/24 hours in 250 mL 0.9% Sodium Chloride. Infuse by continuous IV infusion at 10 mL/hr on days 8 through 28.  Do not flush or interrupt blinatumomab infusion line. Infuse exactly at ordered rate through a dedicated lumen. Do not increase the rate of infusion to finish the bag; start new bag every 24 hours. There will be residual medication left in the bag, dispose of properly. Use IV tubing that contains a sterile, non-pyrogenic, non-DEHP, low protein-binding, 0.2 micron in-line filter.

Nursing Orders 
INPATIENT
PRETREATMENT
Verify that patient meets the lab parameters for administration.
Complete Neurological doc flowsheet prior to administration.
ADMINISTRATION
Begin 0.9% saline as primary line to keep vein open. 
Perform assessment for toxicity and tolerance.
Monitor for signs and symptoms of Cytokine Release Syndrome, which can include nausea, vomiting, fever, fatigue, chills, hypotension, rash, and wheezing.  Notify provider if Cytokine Release Syndrome is suspected.
Monitor for neurological toxicities such as encephalopathy, convulsions, speech disorders, disturbances in consciousness, confusion and disorientation, and coordination and balance disorders. Notify provider if neurological toxicity is suspected.
Do not alter rate.
Do NOT interrupt blinatumomab infusion.
Do not flush the blinatumomab infusion line. Flushing the line when changing bags or at completion of infusion can result in excess dosage.  If infusion line needs to be cleared, infuse 0.9% saline (see separate order). 
EDUCATION/TEACHING
Instruct patient to contact health care team if experiencing signs or symptoms of neurological toxicities including convulsions, speech disorders, and confusion.
Instruct patient to contact health care team if experiencing signs or symptoms that may be associated with Cytokine Release Syndrome including fever, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, chills, hypotension, rash, and wheezing.
Advise patient to refrain from driving and engaging in hazardous activities while blinatumomab is being administered.
