Provider Reminders 
Protocol for patients who weigh 45 kg or more.
Dexamethasone 10 mg/m2 PO/IV (with increase to max 24 mg/day) daily during screening/pre-phase until cycle 1 day 1 mandatory for all patients in whom proportion of blasts exceeds 50% or peripheral blast count greater than or equal to 15,000
Dexamethasone 10 mg/m2 PO/IV (with increase to max 24 mg/day) daily during screening/pre-phase until cycle 1 day 1 recommended if LDH indicates rapidly progressing disease or extramedullary high tumor load.
Hospitalization is recommended for the first 9 days of the first cycle and the first 2 days of each subsequent cycle. 
It is recommended to avoid starting therapy on the weekend.
Consider tocilizumab 4 mg/kg IV over 1 hour for grade 3 or grade 4 Cytokine Release Syndrome, or if no response to supportive care for grade 2 toxicity.  Dose may be repeated if clinical improvement does not occur within 24 to 48 hours.
