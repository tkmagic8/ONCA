Nursing Orders
PRETREATMENT
Verify that patient meets the lab parameters for administration.
Perform assessment for toxicity and tolerance
Ensure that patient has discontinued any NSAIDs if instructed by provider to do so.  Remind patient not to restart for 48 hours after infusion.
TREATMENT  
Begin 0.9% saline as primary line to keep vein open 
Flush IV line with minimum of 30 ml of primary solution before and after each chemotherapy drug
Administer pembrolizumab as an intravenous infusion only with a 0.22 micron in-line filter 
If patient experiences venous irritation during infusion, assess on pain scale of 0 to 10 and titrate and run fluids concurrently. 
>  Mild pain level of 0 to 3: Increase fluids to 100 mL/hr 
>  Moderate pain level of 4 to 6: Increase fluids to 200 mL/hr 
>  Severe pain level 7 to 10: Increase fluids to 300 mL/hr 
Consult MD regarding diarrhea management
Infusion related reaction with carboplatin: STOP infusion immediately, and begin primary solution at wide open rate, notify MD, begin monitoring vital signs and administer prn medication for infusion reaction; once symptoms have resolved, consult with MD on rate to resume carboplatin infusion
EDUCATION/TEACHING
